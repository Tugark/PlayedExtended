# PlayedExtended
Little addon that tracks your `/played` time across all your characters on all realms and across factions.

## Usage
The addon itself updates the internal statistics everytime you login or logout, as well as when you manually run /played. This means that you have to login at least once per character to get their statistics updated.

To show the statistics, run `/pe`.

To reset the internal database, run `/pe reset`. Please note that this will wipe the whole database.
